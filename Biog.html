	<p> <h4>2013-Present &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  <a href="http://www.dit.ie/catalogue/Programmes/Details/DT265">DT265 Higher Diploma in Computing</a></h4>Dublin Institute of Technology</p>
	<p><strong>Subjects:</strong>  Systems Analysis and Testing; Object Orientated Software Development; Web and User Interface Design; Information Systems</p>
	<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> The aim of the higher diploma in computing is to map a crossover path into careers in computing for graduates from other disciplines. 
	Students of this programme will acquire core knowledge of computing concepts and a deeper knowledge in Software Development and Information Technology 
	Infrastructure. The students chosen for this course have already developed transferable skills in analysis, communications and independent learning 
	from their previous Level 8 degree. Many students of this program will also have different skill-sets developed through work and real world experience. 
	This program builds on all these different qualities of the student and teaches them to learn new skills and how to adapt to new technologies. 
	This is very important in a rapidly changing technological environment. I chose this course because I was seeking a new direction and challenge, 
	and it seems like a good way to focus and hone my own unique skill-set for a career in I.T.</p>
