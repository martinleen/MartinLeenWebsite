		<h3>From Metropolis to Necropolis: Modernity and the American City in Sunrise and The Big Sleep</h3>
		The American city is both the backdrop and an important character in both F.W. Murnau’s Sunrise and Howard Hawk’s 
		The Big Sleep. While both of these films are very different they both offer a snapshot of the American psyche and 
		how it was affected by urban life during two different phases of modernity. In 1913 the French writer Charles Peguy 
		remarked that “the world has changed less since the time of Jesus Christ than it has in the last thirty years.” He 
		was speaking of the conditions of Western capitalist society: its idea of itself, its sense of history, its beliefs, 
		morals, pieties, modes of production among other things. To begin with this article will explore concept of modernity, 
		and the effect that the profound changes it brought with it had on the people who lived through it. Having explored the 
		conditions of modernity the article will reflect on how Sunrise and The Big Sleep articulated the effect that some of 
		these conditions had on the human psyche during two different stages of modernity.

		<h3>The Myths and Stereotypes of Branding National Identity</h3>
			This essay examines the concept of nation branding which has gained popularity in business, 
			policy and intellectual circles in the last fifteen years. Under the pressures of globalisation 
			numerous countries have invested in branding efforts in the hopes of producing images of the country 
			that will attract more trade, tourism and investment. To begin with this article will consider the concept 
			of nation branding as propagated by its advocates such as Olins and Anholt. Having unpicked what is at stake here the essay will 
			take a critical approach and unpack the implications that nation branding holds for democracy, and using the 
			publication Understanding our Brand will show that nation branding reduces national identity to stereotypes 
			and myths suitable for consumption by a globalised market.

		<h3>Government Policy and the Irish Audio-Visual Industry</h3>
			In the 2012 budget  Michael Noonan extended the Film Tax Relief Scheme(Section 481) to 2020, and also decided on some 
			other reforms which would move the to a tax credit model, so as to ensure better value for tax payers money. 
			Changes to Section 481 have been the cornerstone of the government’s policy towards the film and television industry 
			since it was introduced in 1989. This essay will look at the effect of Irish government policy on the audio-visual industry. 
			The Creative Capital report drew a roadmap for the audio-visual industry which it claimed would double the revenue and the 
			jobs in the sector within five years. In their own review of Section 481 published in 2012 the Irish Film Board proposed their 
			own recommendations for the future of the industry. This paper will explore the recommendations of both of these reports for 
			the development of a sustainable audio-visual industry in Ireland. The creative capital report proposed Screen Australia as a 
			model for a re-mandated Irish Film Board which would oversee the development of the whole Irish audio-visual industry. 
			The essay will also examine some of the initiatives undertaken by Screen Australia which could be used in an Irish context.

		<h3>Good History/Bad History: The the use of “nostalgia” in Contemporary Visual Culture</h3>
			Mining history for inspiration and information has been a characteristic of postmodernism since its inception. 
			This essay will examine Frederic Jameson’s view that postmodern culture has lost its capacity for invention and 
			that all that is left is to rehash old styles as pastiche. Jameson cites the nostalgia film as a symptom of postmodernism’s 
			inability to represent its own present and a symptom of its own cultural amnesia. Nostalgia films are generally understood 
			to be commercial films that recreate the look and feel of films from the past. They tend to stereotype the aesthetic representations 
			of the past, creating the look of a generation—‘the fifties’, for instance—while retaining only the surface effect of that historical period. 
			This essay takes the view that Jameson’s critique is reductive and that even if trawling through history for inspiration popular culture
			still has the power to offer its own critique. Drawing on the work of Linda Hutcheon the paper will show that films and design which 
			examines the past in an inventive and imaginative way films reflect a desire in postmodernism to understand history. To Tibor Kallman 
			the mortal sin in historicism is de-contextualisation and looking at the movie Forrest Gump the paper will explore the effects that 
			de-contextualisation can have. Vera Dika, Paul Grainge and Christine have written extensively about nostalgia and retro in movies and 
			design and the paper aims to show that nostalgic representation can still have critical potential in both film and design.

		<h3>The Institution is dead! Long live the institution! Contemporary Art and New Institutionalism</h3>
			Written in 2004 Claire Doherty’s The Institution is dead! Long live the institution! Contemporary Art and New Institutionalism was a 
			contribution to the then developing discourse on New Institutionalism. This essay will examine what is at stake for Doherty in New 
			Institutionalism. Doherty charts the rise of New Institutionalism as among other things a reaction to the emergence of participatory 
			and relational art practices as a dominant stream in contemporary art. These practises according to Doherty pose challenge to institutions 
			as to how to exhibit in such a way without privileging the social over the visual, and also in a way that renders any participation truly 
			meaningful and engaging. Looking at the work of Alan Dunn with tenantspin in detail the paper will try to unpick the problems facing institutions 
			with regard to sharing or documenting participatory or engaged art practises. The programs of new institutions often involve collaboration between
			the institution and multi-disciplinary artists’ collectives. One such group is 16 Beaver from New York, the essay will examine a project that 
			they created as part of The Interventionists exhibition in MOMMA in 2003. Finally what seems to be lacking in Doherty’s account of 
			New Institutionalism that many of these new progressive institutions were institutions of critique, however under pressure to attract a 
			mass public many of these institutions have changed emphasis. Looking at them from that angle the essay will look at possible models for 
			progressive institutions that would still allow them to offer critique and allow them to develop different publics.
